# HackTheBox-Training
Use of the HackTheBox platform to apply techniques and tools used in the cybersecurity field

[https://www.hackthebox.com/](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point)

It follows a tier system where each tier contains target machines that can be pen-tested. The general goal is to answer revelvant questions and discover a flag (similar to a CTF)

\* Box's are more difficult in higher tiers

\* Machine names may seem arbitray (these were predefined on the website)

\* **Takeaways from each tier will be detailed soon. Due to the terms of service explained earlier, I can't share solutions directly.**

## Objectives:
- Learn the basics of hacking tactics and techniques by using tools, scripts, and overall methodologies to find hidden flags
- Using HackTheBox as the platform, acquire hands-on experience with easy and medium level boxes
- Read write-ups and guides to learn more about the techniques used and tools to find while actively working on a box
- To challenge myself and find the hidden flags without guides or write-ups after learning the basic methodologies

## My Experience:
I enjoyed how practical and methodical the process is. It allowed me to use real world virtual environments (VMs & VPNs) to pen test and understand a target machine. Specfically, the VM I am using is [Pwnbox](https://help.hackthebox.com/en/articles/5185608-introduction-to-pwnbox) (a customized, online Parrot Security Linux distribution with many hacking tools pre-installed)
